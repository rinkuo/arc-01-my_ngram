Character Frequency Counter
Description
This C program provides a simple character frequency counter. It calculates and displays the frequency of each character in a set of strings provided as command-line arguments. The program utilizes functions to find the length of a string (mystr) and print the character frequencies (char1), along with the main function that processes command-line arguments.

Task
The primary task of this program is to analyze and report the frequency of each character in the input strings. It achieves this by iterating through the characters of each string and printing the count of each character.

Usage
Compile the Program:

Compile the program using a C compiler, for example:
gcc character_frequency.c -o character_frequency
Run the Program:

Execute the compiled program, providing strings as command-line arguments:
./character_frequency string1 string2 string3 ...
Replace string1, string2, and string3 with the actual strings you want to analyze.
Installation
No formal installation is required. Simply compile the provided C code using a compatible C compiler.

Example
./character_frequency hello world
Output:

makefile
h:1
e:1
l:3
o:2
w:1
r:1
d:1
This example demonstrates the frequency of each character in the words "hello" and "world."

Feel free to modify and extend the code according to your specific needs.
